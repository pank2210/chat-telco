8|nope thanks!
9|yes please
9|i was offered a  $ 200 american express card when we signed up for new service how long will it take to get that card
9|no a new customer offer
9|sprint
9|we signed up a week or so ago and were promised a  $ 200 american express card for being a new customer
9|yes
9|thank you
9|i cant see the full message
9|this was not for early termination
9|they said i didnt qualify for that since i kept my phone that was attached to the primary number we did however  buy 2 6s plus so i was disappointed that they wouldnt buy out our contract from verizon
9|its only been a week
9|i cant return the phone we used it for my moms lin
9|even though we got two new phones  we could have traded my husbands phon
9|the  $ 200 american express card im looking for was not for the buyout they said it was for customer appreciatio
9|thats not what they said they said we dont qualify for that but we do qualify for the customer appreciation car
9|okay  ill go back to the manager at the store if we give back one of the phones that was on our verizon account  does that qualify for the buy out offer or does it have to be a specific phone
9|do you mean the city or store address
9|1816 e arbors dr&nl;charlotte  nc 28262
9|if we give back one of the phones that was on our verizon account  does that qualify for the buy out offer or does it have to be a specific phone
9|we have 3 lines but gave one phone to my mom are you saying we need to return all 3 phones
9|okay  i dont think thats possible i feel like you guys should honor what we were promised that was the main reason we switched in addition to the 1 2 off the pla
9|we were told we would get the  $ 200 gift card  another  $ 100 credit on our first bill  and a  $ 30 credit because they did not have the 6s plus in the store we had to pick it up the next day at an alternate locatio
9|can you resend your last comment   i cant see i
9|okay  ill call tomorro
9|thanks!

27|yes
27|ok it just finished
27|still has the fast busy tone
27|i cannot get the dial number to work  but it may be because i purchased my phone directly from the manufacturer instead of through sprint

29|am trying to register under my phone number not my wifes
29|can i get the account  number please
30|hi
30|ok
30|what info do you need from me
30|i compared my bill to past months and there was an   access waived thru june 2016
30|i remember this when i first signed up for sprint last year and the operator said that when it hits june again we should be able to get it waived again
30|is there any way to continue it
30|it looks like i went over 8 gb for this month
30|is there another promotion etc
30|id like to keeep my current gb just in case
30|do i currently have 3g or 4g
30|so if i move to the 8gb  once i hit 8gb my service would then move down to 2g
30|i think currently i only have 3g
30|i dont have 4g
30|ok so if i went the new route would it start in the new month  since we already are in aug 14
30|ok can we go ahead with the new plan and have it go into effect on the next billing cycle
30|ok
30|ok thank you
30|nothing else

31|ok
32|hi hannah
32|two questions
32|i need to print the cell phone bills for each month of the year
32|and i need to limit data usage on my sons phone
32|ok
32|ok - - one second
32|ok - got it with the bills
32|thank you
32|yes - sons line is 310.403.8039
32|i would like to set a data limit of 20g per month on his line with no opportunity to go overit just shuts off data at that point
32|will wifi work for data on that phone if the data is blocked
32|will text messages still work
32|ok thank you
32|thanks hannah
32|ok - have a good night
33|i did not get a paper bill but an email cannot access my bill online
33|it wont let me login
33|thats not what i need to know
33|i need to see my bill online  i was not sent the usual paper bill
33|so how come i cannot see my bill online
33|for my online sprint account or for the original phone account
33|nedlaw01742
33|thant is not the username it is the password
33|jeningram
33|it looks like it opened without my typing anything
33|i am looking at the bill
33|i will  but i have to say at first glance this   bill   is laid out differently  does this mean i will no longer receive a paper bill
33|so why does the email say i have added a new account to my sprint profile
33|where in the ebill is the information about what time period this bill covers
33|i am in my account documents  where should i be
33|i am in my online account
33|was i notified about this change to electronic billing
33|how was i notified about this change in billing
33|i ask that you remove any and all   late   charges from this bill  i was not notified on my last paper bill and oall the sprint messages and emails go to spam
33|just because sprint wants to change the way they bill a customer does not mean that the customer should pay additionally for this change with   late   fees when customes did not receive notification
33|thank you
33|thanks  but i am going to try getting it by email  if i do not like it i will go back to paper thanks for your assistance
33|not now  have a good evening
34|i would like to say how disappointed i am with your customer service being rude to my self my mother and the sales accost are that i was talking to in store trying to buy a phone  the dilibretly hung up on is and was no help whats so ever r
34|all i was trying to do was purches an iphone 6s from the apple store and we would get a message saying that my account was not supported  this was the 5th time i called and i am now co so seeing cancelling my arrives and those that i know because of how i a military bet was treated
34|he didnt say his name clearly and would not put the supervisor on the phone as well when asked
34|thank you if the keeps up i will make this public with how i was treated i have never been treated so poorly busy accompany thats ive put thousands of dollars into and still do on service
34|i was at an apple store in las vegas nevada
