3|ive been better i would like to send an email regarding my experience with sprint today can you provide that for me
3|i am asking for an email address so i can do exactly that i would like to include screenshots to show exactly what the issue is is there an email address to send customer service issues to
3|yes  pleas
3|ok
3|all i am asking for is an email address to share my recent experience with sprin
3|okit is a pretty lengthy stor
3|okthe reason i am writing this is to express my concern with the lack of options that sprint has to satisfy their customers when something goes wrong with what should be a normal everyday purchase today i purchased 2 samsung galaxy s7  and added a line of service with a purchase of an iphone se i made a phone call to sprint to find out about the current bogo on the galaxy s7 and determined that ordering online would be more cost effective for me due to the waiving of the activation upgrade fees i spoke michelle did not get her last name or employee id  at this point i did not think it was necessary  as she was very helpful  she advised me that i could order online and there were options regarding shipping direct to my home and in-store pick up i also determined that the bogo was not the best option for me and decided to use the 2 yr upgrade that i was eligible for on 2 of my existing lines so i ordered paid for my 3 phones online with the option to pick up at my local sprint store order  s   ow-srso-<ban>< ban>    ow-srs<ban>< ban>12    ow-s<ban>< ban>3779
3|i went to the store at my scheduled appt time to pick up my phones and gave the order  s to the clerk she was able to locate my orders and asked if these were part of the bogo event and i said no  i used my upgrade and the 2yr contract option to buy these phones she then told me that she could not process this type of transaction 2 yr contract upgrades  at her store 18284 collier av   ste 1200  lake elsinore ca 92530  because of her  immediate responsei could tell she had dealt with this issue many times and told me that she has had many customers come in wanting to pick up phones that they had purchased with the 2 yr contract upgrade and she was not able to help them either i proceeded to tell her that this store was listed online as a location to pick up my phones she said that her system did not have the capability to process 2 yr contracts- there was not a tab or button for her select this option she then advised me to call sprint to see what they could do to help me i kinda thought this should have been something that she should have donebut she was busy helping customers  so i called sprint myself no worries the first person i spoke with eventually got someone in tech support to speak with her and she explained that her system did not have the capability to process this type of transaction she then  passed the phone back to me and the tech person told me that this transaction needed a manager over-ride and this store did not have an on-site manager i asked why this store was listed as an option for me to pick up my phoneshe could not answer that question i then asked to speak to someone that could answer my question he put me on hold and then returned to tell me that his supervisor was busy and could not speak to me and would have to call me back i told him that was unacceptable and that i was not going to wait for a return call  he needed to transfer me to someone that could help me i was then connected with
3|joe oldman sprint id  ua<pin>< pin> upon connection i asked for his name and employee id  he tried to speak over me to start resolving the issue i again said that i would like his name and id  and he gave me his name at this point i was pretty frustrated with this whole situation i told joe that he needed to transfer my order to a store that could process my 2 yr contract purchase he informed me that there were no stores with capability to process 2 yr contract orders i again asked why this was an option onlinehe could not answer that question he told me that this type of transaction could only be processed by phone or online and the only delivery option was to have it shipped to my house i again asked why i was able to chose in store pick up   he could not answer that if this is the only option  why does sprint have this on their website   i can only imagine how many customers go into stores expecting to pick up phones and leave extremely frustrated questioning whether or not to leave sprint joe then told me that my only option was to cancel the original orders and wait for a refund and then reorder the phones and have them delivered to my house i told him that i did not want to cancel anythingi wanted him to ship the phones to my house i asked him to edit my original order and change the method of delivery to expedited delivery he told me that he could not edit my order why   nothing had been picked up or shipped against this order yet   he stated that he had to cancel  wait for refund  and reorder i told him that i did not want to cancel the orderi told him to create a new order and when i received my phones  we could cancel the existing order he told me he could not do that why he stated that once the order was processed  no changes could be made to it sprint needs to fix this in no way is this practice conducive to servicing your customers i agreed to cancel the original orders  and i told him that i wanted the phones to be delivered the next day sunday aug 14  he told me he could not do that why  he said that sprints contract with ups was only for delivery on business days not weekends absolutely ridiculous i told him that amazon delivers on sundaythey need to re-evaluate their contract with ups to include weekend delivery to take care of their customers in situations like this then i asked about them leaving these packages on my doorstep i know that people stealing packages has become a huge issue lately  and that i did not want them left on my porch he told me that in nicer neighborhoods they dont have any issues with thiswhat     and that i would have to go on the ups website and track my package and set up the packages for a specific time to deliver when someone was home or to deliver to a ups store i asked if you could do this for me since i was telling him that is what i wanted  and he said he was sorry he could not do that why   so after all this  i had to cancel my orders  reorder  and wait for my phones to deliver on monday aug 15 and hope they do not get stolen off my porch joe did offer my  $ 50 towards accessories for each of the phonesa total of  $ 150.00 i asked if this could be credited to my account so i could wait for my phones to arrive and have time to browse the sprint store to see what i needed he said that it could not be credited to the account and be spent later why   he said that someone would call me tomorrow to see what i want to buy with the credit so  as you can see  sprint had many opportunities to make this 13 yr customer feel like they were important and appreciated every opportunity they had; they failed i hope this letter is reviewed and new policies and procedures are put in place to help retain your customers this experience doesnt happen too often  im sure but look at how many times a solution was provided and sprint could not resolve very disappointin

16|im here
16|alright i am coming to you with a very heavy heart theres a lot of things wrong with my account
16|first and foremost i added a new line to my account as well as two phones
16|i appreciate it
16|the lines were added during a buy one get one offer for the lg g5
16|the sales rep told me that there should be a credit to zero out the numbers
16|but that does not sho
16|also  when he asked if i would like insurance on the phones  i said no
16|but apparently both lines have insurance on it as well
16|charging me for both last and this mont
16|third  i was told that the line i was adding was a   zero account   meaning it would not affect my bill whatsoever
16|basically a free line with a free phon
16|lastly  on my account i got on installment billing an iphone which was supposed to be 15 month
16|but im being charged regularly
16|leilani desiderio <ban>< ban>6

16|how about the tep
16|i really do appreciate i
16|lastly  the zero account
16|when i was giving my son an upgrade
16|the sales associate mentioned that i could add a line to the account with no extra charge
16|thats what made me get the second lg offer with the bogo
16|otherwise that would have never happened

26|is that when its due  9 4 16
26|thank you for your help
26|im ok not confused just scared of what my bill is going to be since i started ive herd many different numbers
26|thats exactly what im afraid of so another words when my bill is due on 9 25 all basically be paying to bill cycles is that what youre saying
26|so im basically better off just paying it when it generates so i dont get far behind
26|i just like to pay my bills on time and the amount that i know i have to pay the other fees and other things just monthly fee of the 195 but unfortunately now its going to be 265 plus tax thats how i want to pay monthly so when is the best time to do that so that i can just keep paying that
26|so i can just randomly pay little bits at a time like weekly 40 dollars and it goes towards the bill not random things like principal
26|okay thank you very much ill work it out i think itll work out better if i pay weekly that way you dont get hit with a big monthly 1 thank you so much i think that will be all for tonight i appreciate your help
